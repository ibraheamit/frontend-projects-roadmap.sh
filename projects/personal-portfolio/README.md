# 🌐 Personal Portfolio (Responsive Design)

This is a training project as part of the [roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) learning path, specifically under the **"Personal Portfolio"** module.

This project is part of my personal learning journey, focusing on **CSS Styling** and **Responsive Web Design** techniques.

The goal of this project was to transform a basic **HTML structure** into a fully styled **Personal Portfolio** with a responsive layout, making use of modern CSS practices like **Flexbox**, **Box Model**, and **Media Queries**.
